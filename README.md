## 1. What accessibility challenges did you face, and how did you address them?
- I did not face many.  The biggest one I faced and haven't been able to fix is making the hamburger icon drop nav menu down when hovered over using a keyboard.  For now I've left tabindex off while I research solutions


## 2. How did you ensure that your design was responsive and accessible to all users?
- Using f12, reshaping/resizing area to see how the webpage reacts to different sizes.  Contrasting colors to ensure good text contrast.  Alt text for image, added role: navigation to hamburger dropdown on smaller screens
- doublechecked all semantics to ensure html is proper, and anything needed is labelled

## 3. What tools or resources did you find most helpful during this project?
- coolors.co for color pallette
- csstricks.com for grid and flexbox reference
- downloaded axe accessibility linter on VS Code to doublecheck for issues in accessibility
- w3schools for anything html or css related outside grid/flexbox
